This is a prototype of deterministic question generator to test RAG systems.

STEP1: Given a seed number, it will generate a subset of files to include in the test. This subset will
include SHA1 hashes of the files to ensure that the same files are used in the test. It will also include
the company name extracted from that PDF.

STEP2: Given the subset of files, it will generate a set of questions to ask about the companies
