"['N/A', 'PowerFleet, Inc.']",Answer: AutoCanada,"PowerFleet, Inc.",N/A,N/A,"PowerFleet, Inc.",N/A,"To determine which company had a higher free cash flow in the fiscal year 2022 among ""TSX_ACQ"", ""QUIDELORTHO CORPORATION"", and ""PowerFleet, Inc."", we need to look at the free cash flow figures for each company. Free cash flow is typically calculated as:

\[ \text{Free Cash Flow} = \text{Operating Cash Flow} - \text{Capital Expenditures} \]

Based on the provided context, we only have the cash flow information for PowerFleet, Inc. for the fiscal year 2022:

- **PowerFleet, Inc.**: 
  - Net cash used in operating activities: $(7,003)$ thousand
  - Capital expenditures: Not provided in the context

For ""TSX_ACQ"" and ""QUIDELORTHO CORPORATION"", the free cash flow figures are not provided in the context. Therefore, we cannot compare the free cash flow of these companies without additional data.

Given the available information, we can only state the free cash flow for PowerFleet, Inc., which is incomplete due to the missing capital expenditures figure. For a complete comparison, the free cash flow data for ""TSX_ACQ"" and ""QUIDELORTHO CORPORATION"" would be required.

Thus, the answer is:
